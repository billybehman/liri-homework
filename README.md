## The problem the app is trying to solve
 The app is giving users an easy way to access information on songs, concerts, and movies.
 
## App organization and how to use it
The app is created with four key phrases; "spotify-this-song," "movie-this," "concert-this," and "do-what-it-says." Each of these phrases will run a different function. "spotify-this-song will take the name of the song that the user inputs and it will give the user the artist name, the track name, the album name, and a preview URL of as many responses as the spotify API provides. movie-this, takes the name of the movie from the user's input and gives back information on that movie. The information from the movie-this input gives the title, the rating, the year, the IMBD rating, the language, the country and the plot. The concert-this function takes a band that the user inputs and shows the next six upcoming shows as well as information on those shows such as the venue and date. The do-what-it-says function reads a text file called random.txt. Inside random.txt there is a command. This command will either be spotify-this-song, movie-this, concert-this. Next to this command there is a song, movie, or band. Application will take the function and run it as if the song, movie, or band was put in by the user next to the method.
